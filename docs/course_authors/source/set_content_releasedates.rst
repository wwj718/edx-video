Subsection
**********

Subsections inherit the release date of the section they are in, but you can
change this date so that different subsections are released at different times.

Note that if the release date for a subsection falls before the release date for
the section that contains it, students will not be able to see the subsection
until the release date for the *section *has passed. Section release dates
override subsection release dates.

   To set the release date for a subsection:

    1. Click to open the subsection.

    2. Locate the **Subsection Settings** box in the top right corner.

    3. Under **Release Date**, change the date.

Unit
****
     
Individual units inherit the release date of the subsection they are in, but
have an additional **Visibility** setting that can be set to **Public** or
**Private**. Private units are never visible to students.

.. note::

You can modify private units directly. To modify a unit that is marked
Public you must create a draft.

    1. Click to open the unit.
  
  
    2. Locate the **Unit Settings** box in the top right corner.
