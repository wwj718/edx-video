Export or Import a Course
*************************
 
Studio has an Import tool and an Export tool that allow you to import and
export courses.

 
Export a Course
***************
 
You can export a course that has been created in Studio. You can export a
course for use by another instructor, or you can back up your course.
 
 
For example, you may create a course in Studio, and then run that course. A
friend or colleague, including a friend from another institution, may be
interested in running their own customized version of that course. You can
export the course that you have created and give it to the other instructor.
That instructor can then import the course, make any changes that are
necessary to reflect that instructor's situation, and then release the
course to students.
 
 
Or, you may export your course, and then make changes to your course in
Studio. If you later want to revert to the earlier version of your course,
you can import the version that you exported. Be careful if you do this
while you are running your course, as you could lose your students' work.
 
 
When you export your course, Studio creates a **.tar.gz** file that includes
the following course data:
 
 
1. Course structure (the order of sections and subsections)
 
 
2. Individual units
 
 
3. Individual problems
 
 
4. Additional pages
 
 
5. Files on the Files & Uploads page
 

 
The exported file does not include the following data:
 
 
1. Student or user data
 
 
2. Discussion forum data
 
 
3. Course settings
 
 
4. Certificates
 
 
5. Grading information

Import a Course
***************


 
.. warning::

	This feature should be used with caution!
	Importing a new course will delete all course content currently associated
	with your course and replace it with the contents of the uploaded file. 
	Importing a course cannot be undone.
 
 
You can import courses that have already been created in Studio. These can
be courses that you or someone else has created and exported.
 
 
The file that you import must be a **.tar.gz** file that contains, at a
minimum, a Course.xml file in a course data directory. The tar.gz file must
have the same name as the course data directory.
 
 
If your course uses legacy layout structures, you may not be able to edit
the course in Studio, although it will probably appear correctly on Edge. To
make sure that your course is completely editable, ensure that all of your
material is embedded in a unit.
 
 
To import a course:
 
 
1. On the navigation bar, click **Tools**, and then click **Import**.
