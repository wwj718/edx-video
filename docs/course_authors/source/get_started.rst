Introduction
************

Since the launch of edX to our original partners, we have been working to provide opportunities for additional educators to create courses on our platform. The fruits of our efforts are Edge and Studio. These tools are available not only to our edX partners, but to all faculty at consortium universities.



EdX (http://edx.org) is our original, premiere learning portal. Publication to edX is available on a limited basis, depending on your university’s agreement with edX. You need specific approval from your university to release your course on the edX portal.

Edge (http://edge.edx.org) is our newest online learning portal. It is almost identical to edX.org both visibly and functionally. 

Edge is where you view the content you create with Studio, our course authoring tool, and where students will view your course. Instructors are encouraged to use Edge to experiment with creating courses. You do not need approval to release a course on Edge—you can create a course and release it immediately.

Studio (http://studio.edge.edx.org) is our web-based course authoring tool. It is the easiest way for educators to develop courses for the edX platform. You can create courses in Studio and view and enroll in them instantly on Edge—even before you have finished creating the course.



**There is a workflow to getting started.** Here is a quick summary:



1. First, go to: https://studio.edge.edx.org. Sign up and create an account.

*****************
Create an Account
*****************

To begin using Studio, create an account with a unique user ID and password. A Studio account isn't the same as an edX account. Even if you already have an edX account, you still need to create a separate Studio account. You can use the same e-mail address for both accounts.

When you create your account on Studio, an account on Edge is automatically created using the same user name and password. You don't have to create separate accounts on Studio and Edge. 

Edge has two views - an Instructor view and a Student view. When you view your course on Edge, you view your course as an instructor, and you see the **Instructor** tab at the top of the page.

Your students will view your courses in Student view, which is similar to Instructor view, but does not include the Instructor tab or release dates. 

To create an account:

1. Go to http://studio.edge.edX.org. The Welcome to edX Studio page opens.

Once you have created a course in Studio, it will be listed on this page. From here, you can start creating courses immediately by clicking the **New Course** button.


To create a new course:

1. Click **New Course.** A screen opens.


.. note::

	Enter your new course information carefully. This information becomes part of the URL for your course. To change the URL after the course is created, you must contact edX through the Help site (http://help.edge.edx.org).Additionally, because this information becomes part of your course URL, the total number of characters in the following three fields must be 65 or fewer.


2. For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name may be “Sets, Maps and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the course title.

3. For **Organization**, enter the name of your university. Do not include whitespace or special characters.

4. For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For example, for public health course number 207, enter "PH207". For math course 101x, enter “Math101x”. Do not include whitespace or special characters in the course number.

   *Note: If your course will be open to the world, be sure to include the "x". If it is exclusively anon-campus offering, do not include the "x".* 

5. Click **Save.**

*Note: Although the start date is set to the current date by default, your course will not be advertised, so it will not be visible to the general public. You can change the start date of your course in Studio.*
