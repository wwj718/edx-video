    This store persists mappings among the addressing schemes. At this time, it's between the old i4x Location
    tuples and the split mongo Course and Block Locator schemes.

    edX has used several different addressing schemes. The original ones were organically created based on
    immediate needs and were overly restrictive esp wrt course ids. These were slightly extended to support
    some types of blocks may need to have draft states during editing to keep live courses from seeing the wip.
    A later refactoring generalized course ids to enable governance and more complex naming, branch naming with
    anything able to be in any branch.

    The expectation is that the configuration will have this use the same store as whatever is the default
    or dominant store, but that's not a requirement. This store creates its own connection.

        Add a new entry to map this course_location to the new style CourseLocator.course_id. If course_id is not
        provided, it creates the default map of using org.course.name from the location (just like course_id) if
        the location.cateogry = 'course'; otherwise, it uses org.course.

        You can create more than one mapping to the
        same course_id target. In that case, the reverse translate will be arbitrary (no guarantee of which wins).
        The use
        case for more than one mapping is to map both org/course/run and org/course to the same new course_id thus
        making a default for org/course. When querying for just org/course, the translator will prefer any entry
        which does not have a name in the _id; otherwise, it will return an arbitrary match.

        Note: the opposite is not true. That is, it never makes sense to use 2 different CourseLocator.course_id
        keys to index the same old Locator org/course/.. pattern. There's no checking to ensure you don't do this.

        NOTE: if there's already an entry w the given course_location, this may either overwrite that entry or
        throw an error depending on how mongo is configured.

        map methods, this one doesn't take the old-style course_id.  It should be called with
